Poetry Android

It was a complete android application project, completed by me in 32 days, it is a poetry app that has amazing UI
which gives the user good interaction with an application, 

so it was my first project learning and developing both took place at the same time 

The tech stack I use in this project is:-

1. Lottie Animation
2. Java for backend 
3. Adobe XD for editing images and icon
4. External third party library (Image Cropper, Colore picker)
5. Google Ads for showing sample ads in the app
6. Google analytics analyze the user activity
